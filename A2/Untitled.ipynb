The fish (entree) and oyster rockefellers were my favorite. The food came out one after the other and on time. I love when I don't have to wait too long for my food on a busy night and still have it come out presentable and taste amazing.

Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.\\n\\nGlobe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.\\n\\nI suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.\\n\\nThe main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.\\n\\nThe dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.\\n\\nDespite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.\\n\\nTruth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.\\n\\nIt was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.\\n\\nNext up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.\\n\\nThose scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.\\n\\nOur next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.\\n\\nNext up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.\\n\\nOur final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.\\n\\nNext up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!\\n\\nFinally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.\",\"useful\":4,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.\\n\\nIt was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.\\n\\nThe stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.\\n\\nNow I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the \\\"best\\\" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. \\n\\nNow I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. \\n\\nUnlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. \\n\\nAlthough funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.\\n\\nAn unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.\\n\\nOn a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.\\n\\nSeated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.\\n\\nUpon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.\\n\\nAfter a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.\\n\\nBefore these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.\\n\\nJust as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.\\n\\nNext, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.\\n\\nOverall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.\\n\\nOffering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the \\\"best ever,\\\" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. \\n\\nFor dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the \\\"gourmet\\\" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. \\n\\nMost appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. \\n\\nBetty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":2}\n",

A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nOne such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the dÃ©cor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.\\nMy friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.\\n\\nWe submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a \\\"Christmas burger\\\" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. \\n\\nAlso sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. \\n\\nIf you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. \\nNo matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!\\n\\nBy the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch.

Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.\\n\\nInside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...\\n\\nThis restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.\\n\\nWith that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.\\n\\nWell to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.\\n\\nA variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflÃ© of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.\\n\\nOne benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.\\n\\nQuite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.\",\"useful\":5,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":3}\n",

Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.\\n\\nA number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.\\nLately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.\\n\\nWith our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...\\n\\nThe pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.\\n\\nSide dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.\\n\\nThe small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.\\n\\nOverall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.\",\"useful\":8,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.\\n\\nIf the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.\\n\\nThe food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.\\n\\nThey've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.\\n\\nAnd the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.\\n\\nIt's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.\\n\\nThe Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.\",\"useful\":16,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":9}\n",

The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\\n\\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\\n\\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\\n\\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\\n\\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\\n\\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\\n\\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.\\n\\nA spur of the moment, \\\"Thursday night out\\\" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.\\n\\nThe wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.\\n\\nThe appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.\\n\\nFor our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.\\n\\nThe braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.\\n\\nThe prices are right, entrÃ©es run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.\",\"useful\":7,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \\\"diner\\\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\\n\\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\\n\\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \\\"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\\\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\\n\\nWe went with the \\\"Bambamburger ($11.50),\\\" which is 2\\/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \\\"Bambamburger,\\\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\\n\\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\\n\\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.\",\"useful\":8,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":3}\n",

Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?\\n\\nOne thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.\\n\\nIt is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.\\n\\nThe menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrÃ©e, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrÃ©e-and it came in at under $5.\\n\\nFor the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.\\n\\nOne of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.\\n\\nOverall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all \\\"I heart\\\" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.\\n\\nPancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.\\n\\nIt was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.\\n\\nFull of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.\\n\\nThe churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.\\n\\nWe started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.\\n\\nLater at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of cafÃ© con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.\\n\\nThe bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.\\n\\nNow I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do \\\"heart\\\" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":1}\n",

It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.\\n\\nThe menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.\\n\\nFirst, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.\\n\\nNext up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!\\n\\nTraditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.\\n\\nUnder recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.\\n\\nOnce 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.\\n\\nOverall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.\",\"useful\":8,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":3}\n",

It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.\\n\\nFirst things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.\\n\\nBrunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.\\n\\nThat, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.\\n\\nThey've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?\\n\\nDespite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":2}\n",

Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.\\n \\nThe camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. \\n\\nWhile (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). \\n\\nAs for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  \\n  \\nRegardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. \\n\\nOur waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  \\n\\nWe started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. \\n \\nWe chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.\\n \\nNo sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. \\n\\nNow when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \\\"Eat Drink Man Woman\\\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.\\n\\nThree hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...\\n\\nMomofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.\\n\\nWith the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.\\n\\nAs you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.\\n\\nFirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!\\n\\nNext came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!\\n\\nWe then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and cruditÃ©; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.\\n\\nAnd then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.\\n\\nLastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,\\n\\nWe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.\\n\\nAll in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.\\n\\nWith considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.\\n\\nTrouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...\\nThere's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.\\n\\nThe West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.\\n\\nThe Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.\\n\\nMuch the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.\\nIt's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.\\n\\nPerhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.\\n\\nSeriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.\\n\\nFirst off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.\\n\\nI ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.\\n\\nSpeaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.\\n\\nThe seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.\\n\\nSitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.\\n\\nAlthough we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.\\n\\nOn the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.\\n\\nO.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...\",\"useful\":15,\"funny\":3,\"cool\":1}\n",

This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.\\n\\nArriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.\\n\\nWithin seconds we were greeted by the two servers\\/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.\\n\\nTaking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.\\n\\nPerusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.\\n\\nAt the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.\\n\\nOverall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food.

It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.\\n\\nAt first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair\\/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  \\n\\nAs it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.\\n\\nThe quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. \\n\\nFood however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.\\n\\nFootnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.\\n\\nIt was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!\\n\\nAnd if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.\\n\\nI started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.\\n\\nBetween the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.\\n\\nOn a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.\\n\\nIf Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.\\n\\nFor a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).\\n\\nUtopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":2}\n",

What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.\\n\\nYou might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.\\n\\nWe started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved \\\"Chef David's\\\" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.\\n\\nFor appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeÃ±o ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeÃ±os offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.\\n\\nNext we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.\\n\\nFor our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purÃ©e, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.\\n\\nWe also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso aÃ±ejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso aÃ±ejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.\\n\\nWith dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.\\n\\nFor dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.\\n\\nGo try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.\\n\\nSee you there...\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.\\n\\nThe big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. \\n\\nOnce you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.\\n\\nThe inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.\\n\\nI'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. \\n\\nI haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.\\n\\nIt was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  \\n\\nI started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.\\n\\nNext, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  \\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;\\n\\n Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. \\n\\n Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.\\n\\nThe French Grilled Toast is like a mÃ©nage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.\\n\\nSo in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  \\n\\nFootnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.\",\"useful\":11,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":3}\n",

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.\\n\\nOk. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.\\n\\nThe brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.\\n\\nThe staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.\\n\\nThe thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.\\n\\nPeople rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.\\n\\nMake no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.\\n\\nSo would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.\",\"useful\":7,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.\\n\\nLil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.\\n\\nWhen I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.\\n\\nLil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.\\n\\nAnd the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.\\n\\nLil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.\\n\\nLil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.\\n\\nThe dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.\\n\\nI head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza.

They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  \\n\\nFirst off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.\\n\\nFruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest.

If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.\\n\\nAunties and Uncles loses points in service.

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.\\n\\nI'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. \\n\\nLa Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nBut one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. \\n\\nPerfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.\\n\\nOn this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.\\n\\nSeriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West.

Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.\\n\\nI recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most clichÃ© lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. \\n\\nThere is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.\\n\\nI held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. \\n\\nTruthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautÃ©ed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!\\n\\nI felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.\\n\\nOverall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. \\n\\nGood boy, Murray.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then.

The \\\"fresh and never frozen\\\" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.\\n\\nTheir burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).\\n\\nIf you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.\\n\\nI actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.\\n\\nMuch like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a \\\"perfect\\\" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.\\n\\nTheir name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.\\n\\nWe started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrÃ©e on its own.\\n\\nThe duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.\\n\\nNext up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.\\n\\nFor those looking for the \\\"cafÃ©\\\" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.\\n\\nAux Delices CafÃ© offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.\\nGourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!\\n\\nWalking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.\\n\\nWhen I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, \\\"was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?\\\" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a \\\"day-old cupcake.\\\" So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.\\n\\nThe cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.\\n\\nA dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.\\n\\nWant to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or \\\"trans\\\" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.\\n\\nOn one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":3}\n",

The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .\\n\\nTraditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.\\n\\nEveryone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chÃ©vre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.\\n\\nOverall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.\\n\\nFirst thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.\\n\\nOk. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.\\n\\nNuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.\\n\\nPersonally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. \\n\\nWanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.\\n\\nOnce seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the \\\"red sauce\\\" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The \\\"white sauce\\\"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)\\n\\nWe opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.\\n\\nOur appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.\\n\\nOur funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)\\n\\nOur second pizza - the San Andreas - was a \\\"New World Pizza\\\" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.\\n\\nFinally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.\\n\\nOverall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.\\n\\nLa Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy.

Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.\\n\\nLa Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.\\n\\nThey're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.\\n\\nPresentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.\",\"useful\":7,\"funny\":3,\"cool\":2}\n",

You can get a 1\\/4 or 1\\/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.\\n\\nThe menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.\\n\\nI decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their \\\"famous\\\" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.\\n\\nOne of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.\\n\\nI do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!\\n\\nConsidering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.\\n\\nIf I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work.

With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.\\n\\nBut, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...\\n\\nAll-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.\\n\\nAll of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.\\n\\nDark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.\\n\\nTruth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":0}\n",

I loved the rickety setting and little details like the \\\"Draught: Use Your Eyes\\\" sign behind the bar.\\n\\nBut, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.\\n\\nThe menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.\\n\\nWhile the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.\\n\\nI have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.\\n\\nI give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist\\/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.\\n\\nI was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new \\\"go-to\\\" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!\\nPutting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.\\n\\nThe dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their \\\"specialty cuisine\\\" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.\\n\\nAfter some quality deliberation between the Tibet\\/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. \\n\\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design dÃ©cor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try \\\"Little Tibet\\\" further down Queen Street.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.\\n\\nThere really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.\\n\\nThe menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.\\n\\nI've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.\\n\\nI went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.\\n\\nHoly Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.\",\"useful\":5,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":3}\n",

And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.\\n\\nSo, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...\\n\\nA few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.\\n\\nThe Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.\\n\\nThe Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.\\nWorking with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.\\n\\nOne other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.\\n\\nKeep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.\\n\\nThe Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.\\n\\nThe menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.\\n\\nMy dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.\\n\\nMy dining partner, an \\\"adventurous\\\" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrÃ©e. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate CafÃ© (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. \\n\\nTheir menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.\\n\\nAfter my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.\\n\\nI've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.\\n\\nThen, I went back for lunch. \\n\\nWe started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrÃ©e was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person\\n\\nThere is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. \\n\\nSo, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. \\n\\nJust doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different dÃ©cor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.\\n\\nAfter a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.\\n\\nI snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!\\n\\nAs for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.\\n\\nAs I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.\\n\\nFor a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!\\n\\nAt the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only dÃ©cor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.\\n\\nSavoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.\\n\\nNow, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.\\n\\nPleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.\\n\\nI know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.\",\"useful\":8,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.\\n\\nMy friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.\\n\\nAs it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.\\n\\nThere is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.\\n\\nThe menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.\\n\\nOur pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.\\n\\nI wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier\\/order taker\\/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.\\n\\nFor a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrÃ©e selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked \\\"what would I like it on?\\\" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with \\\"spaghetti,\\\" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.\\n\\nWe each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.\\n\\nThe food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.\\n\\nThe saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.\\n\\nHey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.\",\"useful\":5,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.\\n\\n3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).\\n\\nOne thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.\\n\\nMuch like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.\\n\\nBut with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.\\n\\nBecause none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.\\n\\nIf you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.\\n\\nWith a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.\\n\\nFresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.\\n\\nBut don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.\\n\\nBuster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.\\n\\nChances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.\\n\\nTruth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!\\n\\nJust like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.\\n\\nChef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.\\n\\nLunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.\\n\\nOur dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.\\n\\nTheir fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.\\n\\nIf your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.\",\"useful\":4,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":1}\n",

Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.\\n\\nI love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.\\n\\nAnd like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).\\n\\nSitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.\\n\\nAs I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange\\/banana\\/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.\\n\\nThe glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.\\n\\nThis would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":1}\n",

New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.\\n\\nWith a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).\\n\\nMy server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.\\n\\nNext, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.\\n\\nAs full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.\\n\\nI had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.\\n\\nPaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...\\n\\nBecause of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.\\n\\nPachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron dÃ©cor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.\\nTheir menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrÃ©e.\\n\\nFor our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeÃ±o peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesÃ³n-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. \\n\\nFor those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeÃ±o in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. \\n\\nThe drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. \\n\\nOverall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy dÃ©cor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.\",\"useful\":4,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...\\n\\nDrake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?\\n\\nNope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.\\n\\nBecause they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.\\n\\nWelcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.\\n\\nBesides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.\\n\\nLike I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.\",\"useful\":4,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":1}\n",

And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.\\n\\nThe restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of dÃ©cor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.\\n\\nMy friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.\\n\\nThe first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings\\\" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..\\n\\nNext came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.\\n\\nAfter that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!\\n\\nIf you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!\\n\\nAnd while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!\\n\\nTo balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.\\n\\nUpon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as \\\"Asian fusion\\\" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. \\n\\nFirst off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.\\n\\nThe fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.\\n\\nThe space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.\\n\\nNext time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.\\n\\nCheck out our blog at www.tofoodreviews.com\",\"useful\":4,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":2}\n",

It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.\\n\\nThis past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. \\n\\nJust when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and\\/or mojitos, and\\/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.\\n\\nWhen our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.\\n\\nSo by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. \\n\\n(Sound of clock ticking)\\n\\nAnother half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. \\n\\nMy mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.\\n\\nLooking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. \\n\\nAfter we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

They have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well. I think it's a testament to the fresh ingredients. Overall, the menu is expansive and does not disappoint. See you guys next time I am in town!\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken.

Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped.

Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.\\n\\nI've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.\\n\\nSo this is what happens when you walk in.\\n\\nI had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. \\n\\nThe doors lock, so you have some privacy.\\n\\nI had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.\\n\\nEach room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.\\n\\nThe flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. \\n\\nAt first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.\\n\\nWhen your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.\\n\\nThere is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)\\n\\nThere was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.\\n\\nI think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. \\n\\nThe one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.\",\"useful\":9,\"funny\":3,\"cool\":6}\n",

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \\n\\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \\\"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\\\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \\\"fighting\\\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \\n\\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \\n\\nIn short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  \\n\\nI used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. \\n\\nHowever, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. \\n\\nBottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.\",\"useful\":7,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.\\n\\nBut luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!\\n\\nI got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.\\n\\nI have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)\\n\\nI also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)\\n\\nGo here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. \\n\\nI believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid.

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race.

I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1\\/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up).

Why not put real YDS ratings?\\n- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.\\n- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.

I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. \\nLeah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like.

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit \\\"homey\\\". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \\n\\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.

It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar.

The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING.

Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. \\n\\n3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6\\/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.\\n\\n4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...\\n\\n5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.\\n\\n6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. \\n\\nOk, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. \\n\\n1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. \\n\\n2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. \\n\\nSo there you go.

Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. \\n\\nMoving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. \\n\\nBottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \\\"oops\\\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \\\"that's not almond\\\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \\\"hurry up\\\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \\\"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\\\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right.

Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights.\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.

I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. \\n\\n2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.\\n\\nOnce you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) \\n\\nSounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in \\\"5 star\\\" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in \\\"5 star\\\" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4\\/15\\/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been \\\"processed\\\" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.\",\"useful\":50,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":3}\n",

We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland.

Truly. I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! \\n\\nWith MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told \\\"no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week\\\" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.\\n\\nI don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!\\nAngela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! \\n\\nSo I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. \\nOne of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol\\nAcross the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   \\n\\nThe staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!\\n\\nIn conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:\\n\\n1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him\\n\\n2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition \\n3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. \\n4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!\\n\\nUPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!\",\"useful\":95,\"funny\":7,\"cool\":4}\n",

I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.\\n\\nService was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread.

Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and \\\"beefy and meaty,\\\" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak.

I think creativity could have been a lot better.\\n\\nService was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino\\/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. \\n\\nLastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. \\n\\nIf you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your.

We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \\n\\nAfter ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \\n\\nFor our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \\n\\nFor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \\n\\nAfter some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\\n\\nThe service was extremely attentive and water refills\\/bread requests came quickly and discretely.

Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.\\n\\nWhat was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2\\/3 ice & 1\\/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. \\n\\nOverall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor.

It's pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is. \\n\\nI thank Bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me. I will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if I need to do a home inspection.

I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. \\n\\nWhat changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. \\n\\nFor example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. \\n\\nI eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. \\n\\nGuys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.\\n\\nUPDATE: May 2017\\nI want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review.

Little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though.  The spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty - three shrimp, some noodles and a sprig of lettuce (I mean sprig too).  All in all, wasn't horrible, just meh.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\\n\\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\\n\\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\\n\\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\\n\\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b\\/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\\n\\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\\n\\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \\n\\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\\n\\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\\n\\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.

I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancÃ©, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for\\/budget\\/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses \\/ accessories very soon.  :)\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people. Toyota is a wonderful company and Big 2 completely hurts their image. Once I get my refund I will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to Power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person.\",\"useful\":14,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":0}\n",

From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a \\\"traditional\\\" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!! It is an awesome place!!\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!\\n\\nWe were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. \\n\\nI had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with \\\"unlimited\\\" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). \\n\\nGoing back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. \\n\\nTo end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.\\n\\nGiving it two stars only because it was \\\"free\\\" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!\",\"useful\":1,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \\n\\nThis is how the story goes:\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8\\/26 to watch the Mayweather\\/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \\\"unexpectedly\\\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table\\/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables\\/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \\n\\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \\n\\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \\n\\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\\n\\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \\n\\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\\n\\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners\\/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":0}\n",

After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. \\n\\nEvelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!\\n\\nI have also had lipo on my previous  \\\"baby\\\" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or \\\"jiggly\\\" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  \\n\\nI am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.

Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how \\\"new\\\" and \\\"modern\\\" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.\",\"useful\":12,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic. So I pay for the dress, and as I'm walking out the door I return to ask the date that the dress will be in.

How upsetting is that! Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said \\\"sorry, it's not available.\\\" And that's all that they would do to remedy the situation. Very disappointed!!!

As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. \\n\\nAfter this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. \\n\\nBefore leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. \\n\\nOnce leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. \\n\\nIt's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. \\n\\nOh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":2,\"cool\":0}\n",

I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. \\nThe next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. \\nMy friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.\\nAt 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said \\\"I do apologize.\\\" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying \\\"I do apologize\\\"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.\\n\\nWhat a terrible experience.

I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic\\/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..\\n \\nEntering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair\\/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down\\/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station\\/massage station separated by a curtain.\\nI wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience\\/professionalism of the service. Please see below:\\n \\n1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.\\n \\n2) Then we went into the massage\\/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand\\/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??\\n \\n3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute \\\"moroccan massage\\\"-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.\\n \\n4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.\\n \\nI really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees\\/services?  Really??  \\n\\nI don't think I will be going back....\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":1}\n",

I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, \\\"Hello?\\\" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with \\\"Yeah.\\\" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, \\\"Yeah, sure,\\\" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.\\nSo, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, \\\"You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,\\\" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.\\nFast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.\\nIf you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate.

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \\n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \\nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\\\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\\\"x6\\\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":3,\"cool\":0}\n",

Never turn into the little plaza where the restaurant is, because there's no space reserved for the restaurant itself! The spaces there are all reserved for other stores in the plaza. So, drive into where the keg is and park there instead, then walk up the small slope to get to the restaurant.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Warm garlic bread was served once we ordered, along with a bottle of tap water. \\n\\nThe pork souvlaki was the tastiest out of the three items. Very tender and juicy! The dip came with warm pita bread, yum! The spanakopita, though, was a bit cold and hard. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a nice experience. Food was good and service was friendly.

Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.\\n\\n  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.

The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.\\n\\nThe rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to.

DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, dÃ©cor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website.

I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.

I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.

My husband and I went there for his birthday in June.  We are both avid foodies and we can say that we had a phenomenal dining experience.  We would definitely go back again.\\n\\nAmbiance:  The interior decor is a bit fancy and modern.  I really like the up lighting.  The high ceiling makes the space look bigger and spacious\\n\\nFood:  We got the Chef's Tasting menu which was at $120 per head.  Good choice for first-timers as you get to try a little bit of almost everything.  The selection might have changed since we came but when we went these were the items in the tasting menu:\\n\\nMarket Oysters with Piquillo Pepper and Tabasco Sorbet, Aged Tequilla Mignonette - I normally don't eat oysters but the flavor was so good that I forgot I was eating oysters.  Don't get me wrong, the oyster taste was still there and it's tasted really fresh.  Actually, this was given as a complimentary item by the Chef\\n\\nAlaskan King Crab with Creamy sunchoke, bacon, and paddlefish roe - I absolutely love this as an appetizer.  I love crabs plus add bacon and I'm a happy camper.  The flavors just melded well.\\n\\nHeirloom Beet Salad  with Duck Prosciutto, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roasted Walnuts, and Celery Vinaigraitte - Light and fresh.  The dressing wasn't overwhelming\\n\\nFoie Gras Brulle with Salted Brioche, Toasted Cocoa Nibs, and Shaved Torchon - interesting way of serving foie gras.  We think the size is too big though for an appetizer. Maybe they can make the serving size a little bit smaller\\n\\nPan-Roasted Sea Scallop  with Jamon Iberico, Green Garlic Flan, Black Trumpet mushrooms  - scallops was cooked perfectly, flavors are just right and compliments each ingredient\\n\\nHerb-Crusted Lamb Saddle with Crispy Sweetbreads, Baby Fennel, Creamy White Polenta - lamb cooked and seasoned well.  I loved the sweetbreads!\\n\\n48 Hour Beef Belly with Shaved Purple Asparagus, Ramp Sorrel Puree, and Toasted Almond - beef is so tender it melts in your mouth.  \\n\\nGianduja Pave  - Olive Oil Ice Cream\\/Hazelnut Crunch\\/Basil Jam - Yes, you read it right.  Olive oil ice-cream???  I had my doubts at first but it was a really good plate cleansing item with all the flavors we just had\\n\\nStrawberry Profiterole - Vanilla Ice Cream\\/Lemon Sorbet\\/Chervil Mousse -  Light dessert, not too sweet,  flavors melded well together. \\n\\nService: Our server was attentive and really knows the menu that she can answer any question we have.  She also saw that I was not enjoying my cocktail since I am not really into citrusy drinks so she suggested to change it\\n\\nWe enjoyed our dinner and it was definitely worth the money we paid. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars for this restaurant was because they didn't do my request to bring out a cake for my husband as requested.

She went away and came back with a firm confirmation that it is for the three bottles of wines and the whole table. I am OK if the restaurant make a mistake and apologize, but NO. The manager went to an extend to deny and repeatedly inviting his staff to join the conversation to make a point that his staff did not make a mistake and it was me who did not get it right. If this is a high end restaurant, then they employed the wrong manager. He kept explaining the logic behind the $50 charge forgotten that the tips for  the dinner is more than the amount and why explained his business logic to a customer. No one is interested of how he does his business or he must make at least $50 profit per bottle of wine. Wonder if he explains to his customer how his chef cook the food when the customer is not happy with the food. North44 charges is high.

In return, we received a very inexpensive 3 night stay in Vegas. This was initially supposed to be a Summer Bay Resorts timeshare vacation, so we also received an Orlando vacation included in the low price ($350 for a 3 night Vegas stay, and 2 night Orlando stay with the option to purchase additional nights for $90 - 2 bdr, 2 ba \\\"luxury\\\" accommodations). At the last minute, Summer Bay switched us over to the BG 36 location, so that is how we ended up there. We had no other option, really, that late in the game.\\n\\nFirst the hotel: website alludes to \\\"luxury\\\" rooms throughout. In reality, they are nothing more than glorified hotel rooms with kitchens. Our 2-bedroom consisted of 2 side-by-side one-bedrooms with a connecting door. Furniture was cheap and uncomfortable. Our smoke detector battery died the first night, so it started beeping extremely loudly during the middle of the night, becoming more frequent as morning approached. Needed a ladder to get to it, so I couldn't pull the battery. Maintenance had to be called. \\n\\nNext, the dishwasher was loose in its cabinet so every time the door was open, the dishwasher just about fell forward - Not ideal with 2 curious toddlers running around. \\n\\nBeds were not comfortable, as stated. Carpet was so dirty that our feet turned black. Pool was indoors, and was not the relaxing environment that is portrayed. Pool bar was never staffed nor stocked - what's the point of promoting it? The sun deck was small - enough said. We went to the Flamingo for a day to go to a real pool.\\n\\nThe good: I asked for, and received, cribs and high chairs for free, and a room with a view of the strip, not the sandlots that surround the resort. The people that work for the hotel were very pleasant and helpful.\\n\\nNow the timeshare: First they don't call it a \\\"timeshare\\\" because it is a club that uses points instead of the traditional timeshare \\\"1-week per year at the same location\\\" club. This one allows you to use your points at anytime and at any BlueGreen club location (or others around the world). Sounds great, right? EXCEPT that when you read reviews, people all over are having trouble booking resorts for the dates they want - Rooms are booked or people don't have enough points because BG assigns higher point values to more popular travel dates!\\n\\nOur timeshare rep was pleasant, but new; so, she kept calling over sleazy and slimy managers to answer my questions. I say 'slimy' because these guys would sell you the shirt off their backs if they could, all the while pretending that they are interested in your life. They are your best buddy to your face, and always have an answer to your concerns about the timeshare. Yet, you also get the feeling that they don't give two-sh*ts about your life and just want the commission from your sale.\\n\\nMore details - We spent 60-90 minutes wasting our time while some phony comedian \\\"entertained\\\" the timeshare crowd in a different room. There was hardly ANY substance to his presentation, and could have been covered in 15 minutes. By the time we were finished with that and met back up with our timeshare rep, 90 minutes had passed. \\n\\nI asked what the buy in cost was at that point - \\\"We'll get to that\\\" is what I was told, and we had to go through the dog-and-pony show of them showing us the same rooms that we were already staying in (because we stayed in the same hotel). We could have skipped this as well.\\n\\nWhen we finally got to the details, it was $32k initial buy-in to get 20,000 pts per year - much higher than I was expecting. On top of that, there are $1200 annual maintenance fees! Of course, you can finance for %17 APR! What? I might as well put it on my credit card - it has a rate half that amount!\\n\\nI said I wasn't interested in paying that much and so the manager started coming over and offering lower and lower cost packages. The final package offered was 8000 pts every OTHER year - with an $11k initial cost and I still had to pay $500 maintenance EVERY year. \\n\\nI asked a question about the point costs per room and if they increase every year. The response was that \\\"no, for existing members, the point costs do not change once you are in the club. That future members' costs will cover point cost increases.\\\" Can you say pyramid scheme?? \\n\\nAfter finally saying no, OF COURSE they have one final offer - 9000 pt sampler plan, where I can try the program out for one year. The catch: It's $700 and you can't use it in June, July or August (surprise, surprise). I passed on it again, and was immediately met with much colder personalities by the rep and managers - which was not surprising. After reading the reviews on this and other websites, I did not want ANYTHING to do with this company. Total time spent was in excess of 3 hours...time that could have been spent with my kid!\\n\\nIn the end, I'm VERY happy that I passed on these offers.\",\"useful\":9,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

The staff was friendly, warm and welcoming.  Check in registration was smooth and easy maybe because the hotel is brand new so they have perfected the system of checking in so you don't have to wait in a long line. Their lobby restroom smelled so good, there's a spa vibe when you get in. The best part of the stay is the pleasure and enjoyment you get when you enter the room. My 8 year old daughter took photos of every single spot because she said the design of the room fits her style. Our room was very modern, spotless clean and cozy. The mini bar is awesome too. I posted some pictures here and you can see how modern and trendy the room was - it's Instagram and facebook worthy. And the bed was so comfortable that I slept like a baby.

The chef was polite enough to reassure us that it would just be a moment. \\n\\nTempura Udon - While super hot in temperature (which is an absolute plus), the shrimp and veggie tempuras were placed into the soup, causing for them to be extremely soggy as a result. Other restaurants place the tempura on a separate dish so if I ever come back, I'd probably request for this! The noodles were not too mushy and not too hard - a well balance.\\n\\nCrispy Butter Roll - This came in a cute triangular roll, which was different.

However, it often fell apart easily if I took more than one bite, so it may be best enjoyed by taking one large bite!\\n\\nChicken Teriyaki Set - Quite pricey for the portion.

Luckily I went on a Sunday instead of a Friday or Saturday, so it wasn't as crazy. They also only take cash, i.e no credit or debit until further notice. \\n\\nFor a party of four, we ordered the following: (1) Singapore Laksa, (2) Green Curry Chicken, (3) Garlic Okra, (4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay Skewers (5) two orders of Roti and (6) a bowl of steam rice! \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered (7) Teh Tarik and (8) Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice-cream. \\n\\n(1) The Singapore Laksa noodles were soft, which is the way I prefer it. Their level is spicy is not too bad - you could probably survive without chugging down your water for this one! I enjoyed having the tofu, the fish slices, and other assorted foods in this one. I'd ordered this again, though if anyone has been to Gourmet Malaysia near Brimley and Sheppard in Scarborough, I'd recommend their Laksa over Restoran Malaysia's. \\n\\n(2) The Green Curry Chicken is a must-order whenever I visit. The green curry is spicy - so be sure to have some water ready. Still, I find it heart warming and absolutely love eating this with rice. The chicken itself is however a bit dry. If i had the option to order Green Curry with veggies, it would be my go to.\\n\\n(3) The Garlic Okra was scrumptious and fun to eat. The slice it up so for those who have some difficulties eating okra uncut, Restoran Malaysia makes lives easier! There was a good amount of garlic so it added flavour. While i thought it could have been less salty, my other party members thought it was just right. This bowl of Garlic Okra was gone the fastest, and it makes a great neutral veggie dish among other spicy orders. I'd order this again. \\n\\n(4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay skewers came with three beef and three chicken, along with some sliced cucumbers and a peanut-sesame sauce. Although I'm not exactly sure of all the ingredients that went into the sauce, it gave off a sweet, sticky, and sesame taste that complemented the meats well. The meats were well seasoned and not over cooked. They were easy to eat, and easy to share. \\n\\n(5) Another order that was easy to share would be the roti. It was soft, and went well with dipping into the Green Curry and even the Laksa for me. While I enjoyed it being soft, a party guest of mine thought the roti could have been crispier. \\n\\n(6) And lastly, rice may be rice, but Restoran Malaysia gives a generous portion for one bowl. It tasted like it was freshly steamed rice without over drying, and also went well with the curry! \\n\\n(7) Their (hot) Teh Tarik was not overwhelmingly sweet and probably \\\"just right\\\". It was nice to balance out the salty and spicy flavours with something sweet. \\n\\n(8) The Banana Fritters with Ice-cream took longer than I expected but perhaps they were getting busy around 7:30 pm. The banana fritters were not too doughy, and maintained their warm temperature. It certainly went well with the vanilla ice-cream. \\n\\nTheir service was wonderful. I didn't have any issues and the waiters\\/servers (we had more than one?) came by frequently to check up on us. \\n\\nI would certainly come again the next time I'm craving Singapore Laksas and Green curry, without wanting to drive all the way to Scarborough!\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

The fish and stingrays all had serious injuries, missing\\/clouded\\/deformed eyes, shredded fins, and many looked very ill.  The bear habitat was a disappointment as it looked dangerous for the little baby bears in it with a huge drop that could injure them.  The hedgehog exhibit was way too small and had no wheel which is very important as they run a lot! The most sickening was the seal exhibit which had a pool about the size of a hot tub and over 3 seals in it just swimming in loops.  We saw they have a larger enclosure but it's only for shows and they didn't have access to it while I was there :(.  There were animals missing from their enclosures such as this one species of ducks which had both escaped and we found them across the zoo playing in a sewage system.

The most painless car transaction yet, and I have owned a few cars! I am from Vegas, saw the car online, purchased it on basis of pictures, description and price. Bought a 2012 Lexus es350-  I couldn't find anything comparable in Vegas after looking and test driving for a month. Steve made the whole process so easy and even personally inspected and texted extra pictures of the car so I could see that it was as nice as I hoped. Was a little apprehensive buying off the net, but it was worth it. When I told him that it would cost me almost $300 airfare to fly down and drive back, he found a local car hauler that delivered the car to my house! Even the loan officer at my credit union said that he was the easiest sales person that she had ever worked with-he was very quick and professional with paperwork, fedex overnighted documents, etc. The car was beautiful and in great shape. Definitely buy from these folks if you see a car online that you want, they make it easy.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

I was so traumatized by the reprehensible handling of my parent's estate by EJ's in 2015 that I couldn't even bear to post a review.  Having accidentally come across a social media comment about EJ's, it brought all that horror back in a flash.  All the negatives that you have seen posted by others should not be taken lightly.  Please believe them and do your own research.  So many people with the same complaints can't be wrong.   My father was a decorated WWII veteran and I consigned some of his memorabilia, much of which had provenance, and they LOST it.  I saw them put up for auction obviously valuable antiques worth several hundreds of dollars in a box lot with an asking price of $10.  One item that was a vintage set was broken up and sold in parts, achieving much lower bid amounts. Many of my items that they auctioned off never even appeared on my inventory list and I had to ask them where it went.  After the owner's wife actually yelled at me on the phone to \\\"stop telling us how to do our business\\\" they corrected my inventory.  How many other people did not check their inventory I wonder.  The inventory errors were rampant.  Other people's items appeared on my inventory list and some of my items appeared on other people's list.  Some of my things never appeared in their auction at all and they claim they never received it, even though I was there and saw it loaded on their truck when they picked up my parent's property.  Before consigning I was told they had a staff of \\\"experts\\\" who would assess my items and would then send the more valuable ones to their sister company J Levines and the not-so valuable items to EJ's.  This did not appear to happen.  I later came across a \\\"help wanted\\\" ad placed by EJ's seeking \\\"pickers\\\" who could sort through consignments and could get their jobs done quickly, with \\\"knowledge of antiques a plus.\\\"  No experience in antiques required, just \\\"a plus\\\" yet I was assured their people were experienced in evaluating antiques & collectibles.  Please do your research on these people and see what you find.  It's startling.  If you do not know what to do with the things you or your loved ones have, sell them yourself or donate them to a charity.  I will live in regret the rest of my life for allowing the desecration of the things my parents left behind after their passing. This company and it's owners acted like predators with regard to my and my parents' personal effects.   I have copies evidencing everything I have stated.

Diagnosis: ligament injury, and then instead of telling me to go to the pharmacy and pick up a thumb splint for $20, he \\\"referrs\\\" me to their friends at Advanced Prostethetics to make an appointment to buy a splint that will cost me $60 and told us to make another appointment to check the thumb after 3 weeks  (deafening sound of bell now)....I'll pass.  Doctor was nice, but that doesn't compensate for what I consider unscrupolous practice that is unfortunately the norm now.\\n\\nVery little \\\"care for patient\\\" sensed here. They are slow to answer the phone and service their patients in office, but very quick to take care of all insurance and financial matters.

The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).  \\nMozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.

IF this was the type of food to be had at the time, I would never have gone back.\\n\\nI think food competition has really been heating up and their expansion was really rapid in the 90's with some sites that just aren't that viable; especially with these super big restaurants; they may just be having financial difficulties.   The Mr. Greek's closer to me home in Richmond Hill make a great take-out but most of the time, the large dining area is almost completely empty.\\n\\nI still heartily recommend the danforth site but their is such a large middle eastern\\/mediterranean community now with similar food choices; it will be hard to go back.\\n\\nHaving said that, I find most of the food chains by the airport to be just a half step below similar franchises elsewhere.  Unfortunately, service today was a full step (or two) behind even average expectations.\\n\\nReally, I would give this place 1.5 stars.  It's not hazardously bad; but bordering on it.  For Toronto, you can expect better.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

We got stuck behind hundreds of people funneling into a corridor that carried people both to Canadian customs and connecting flights. We stood in that crowd until some figured out that 90% of the people were waiting to enter Canada and people with US connections could fight their way through to a line with no one in it. UNTIL that came to a screeching halt down stairs where they were filtering people through customs and security to get US connections. The we waited in a line of 50-70 people with one - count it - one security lane open. A good 30 of those people - including us had a half hour or less to make connecting flights. Evidently some of the airlines held flights to let passengers pass security. We got through just in time to have made it to the gate only to find they had taken us off the flight because we were too late getting through. next nightmare was trying to locate our luggage to get it out of the airport in order to get a hotel for the night.

My husband and I had reservations for two hours before we went to see a show that I've wanted to see for years. We had a Groupon that was two courses (burgers with sides and a dessert) with wine. We were seated (one of six tables with two servers, a manager and a bartender...so not exactly busy) and it took 20 minutes for a server to come by and get us water. We ordered the wine and were ready to order, but he said he'd get the wine first. We waited another 20 minutes. He came back over with the wine and took a good five minutes opening it, telling us that the manager was too busy to get the wine and he usually doesn't open the wine. He then was about to leave and I told him we'd like to order. He took our order and the food came out pretty quickly, about 15 minutes later. It was fine. Not as good as some of the other burger places in Vegas like Holsteins, Burgr or LBS. The fries tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. We ate and then sat another 20 minutes waiting for them to clear our table. When we finally ordered dessert, we waited another 20 minutes until I was livid because we were going to be late for our show. An hour and forty minutes for a one course meal?! Our server came out and told us that they didn't have the dessert we ordered, even though we saw it come out for other guests. They charged us for the extra side we ordered and tax and tip, but since we had to leave we never got the dessert that we had paid for. The manager and server were not apologetic and were quite rude. I would never, never go back to this place. And needless to say, we missed the first 15 minutes of a show I've waited years to see. \\n\\nI typically am very forgiving at restaurants as my husband works in the service industry and I know things can get hectic, but seriously.

I can't believe how bad the service is. \\n\\nThey gave us a quote of $50 for internet and TV for a year. We couldn't believe it--printed off the record of our chat but decided to take the leap--guess we should have known better. \\n\\nTo begin with they opened one account but once they connected us with Direct TV to start the TV portion of the bill then they transferred the account--but they didn't tell us--we were expected to read the fine print in the bill to see that they had changed account numbers. Needless to say we paid bills to the previous account since that's how we set it up. Once that was identified the issue, we called to discuss the account transfer, how they could transfer the money and that they would not report to creditors that we were overdue. Well, three phone calls and 15 hours (no joke) later did they finally act on it. In the meantime they filed creditor claims and tried numerous times to disconnect the account. Each of the three times we spoke to a representative they would tell us it had been resolved. Yet the following week there was no record and money had not been transferred. Now that we have that finally rectified it turns out they did not transfer all the funds and are now claiming we owe them more money despite our bank record stating it was paid. They can't find the funds and have advised it will take another two weeks to do a search--in the meantime we need to pay the full amount or they will mark our account in arrears again!  Get this though, in the same day they supposedly rectified some of the money transfer between accounts, they issued a rebate check and transferred the money. And then again, the had the gall to blame us for their mistake.\\n\\nNow about that $50 deal, we were told that despite printing off records of our conversation complete with the representatives name and ID # that they will not honor that amount there is nothing they can do and we should have known that was not a realistic quote.

Ambiance is kind of cool. The ingress and egress at the entrance is unwieldy. When it's packed, there's no room to get to the restrooms or to the salsa bar, or even around the bar. There's no place for waiting people, to wait. On a Friday night after 6 p.m., we were seated right away. After we arrived, it got really packed. For an appetizer, we got the chips and guacamole. It was $6.99, which seemed pricey to me. But it was delicious. Salsa \\\"bar\\\" has only 4 salsas, and is hard to maneuver when there's more than one person at it. Salsa containers are tiny, so you have to negotiate the crowd to get back to it, and hope you don't spill your salsa on the way back to your table. \\\"Flight\\\" of 3 frozen margaritas for $7 is a bargain and very delicous. Hit the spot! I had the crispy Tilapia tacos, and my partner had the Green Chicken Chili. Both were delicious, but both of us thought they were dry. I had to put a lot of salsa on mine to make it not so dry. Otherwise, it was awesome. Our server, Jennifer, was a delight. She does the baking, and that particular day was National Mango Day, so she had baked Mango Margarita Cupcakes. We took one home, and my partner devoured it. It was awesome. Cupcakes were $3 a piece. It took a long time to get our food, but I attributed that to how busy it was. And we were happy eating chips and guacamole from our window seats. We had planned to use a gift card, and Jennifer kindly added chips and salsa to our take-out order so we got to our gift card total (can't use that particular gift cert to include with the tip).

Another new low in dining service. We were told it would be a 25-minute wait, so we headed to the bar. Were seated at the bar. It took 20 minutes just to get any bartender to notice us. We had money out; we tried to summon them! Nothing. They were too worried about acting like bar backs than bar tenders. Finally received our drinks but with no coasters. They didn't care to clean up the drinks that were there from before we arrived, or remove napkins or anything. We were invisible. And my wine glass was delivered to me HOT! Wine in a HOT wine glass? Geez. We weren't asked if we wanted another drink. Finally our table was called. Whew! We were seated. Again, it took 20 minutes to get more drinks. If you can't staff a bar at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday, you might want to rethink your franchise. The server brought bread and butter. Butter was hard as a rock. I ordered a steak with a wedge salad. My husband ordered a steak salad. His steak salad and my entrÃ©e were delivered after about 30 minutes. No wedge salad. Server went back and got it. No problem. We were still more angry about having to wait and wait and wait for drinks. Wedge had a vinaigrette on it - not to my liking, because it made the lettuce appear brown and weird. Just not the best wedge. And my baked potato was supposed to be \\\"loaded\\\" but had hardly anything on there. Where was the butter? Sour cream? At least put it on the side so I can put as much as I want, on there. And bring more butter. The only redeeming thing was the steak. 12-ounce ribeye was awesome. I ordered the garlic butter on top, and for $1.49, it was a dollop of nothing. But still the steak was the redeemer for the meal. It wasn't the dining server's fault for anything; the bartenders are to blame. And they were wearing Badger T-shirts. I love the hometown loyalty, but they looked sloppy.

Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce.

That's a totally different issue.\\n   If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.

I had a 2 queen suite which could sleep 6 with the pull out couch if you needed it and it was beautiful. 2 large flat panel TVs in the room (one in the bed area, one by the couch) made it comfortable for my insomniac friend to watch TV in the couch\\/desk area when I went to bed. The room had a mini fridge and a microwave in addition to the standard tiny coffee maker - we didn't use these things but they'd be nice for a longer stay. The bathroom was generously sized and was stocked with Bath&Body Works products. At check in we were supplied with complementary breakfast buffet passes. The breakfast was great for free, hash-browns, bacon ,sausage, (instant) scrambled eggs, fruit, yogurt, cereal and the standard mini muffins & bagels. Juice\\/milk\\/coffee were also provided. We didn't have time to use the pool or exercise facilities, but they were there and seemed nice.  With taxes I paid about $140\\/night and I feel like I got my moneys worth.

The pineapple was cut in small sticks, which I almost confused for ginger. Definitely recommend with some rice. The lemongrass chicken was simple, but flavorful. The vermicelli with beef on a stick, was also good, but nothing out of the normal. I prob will need to get an individual bowl for myself next time to get my noodle fix and to really enjoy the dish. Last, but not least, we had the beef cubes and they were very well seasoned. Nice combination to the bed of lettuce, cucumber and tomato it comes with.

I think we may have startled the owner, because 15 minutes later she locked the door to the restaurant and would not allow anymore customers to enter. It was prob 7pm and the restaurant closed at 10pm? Rest assured she did reopen the door after our meals were served and she could handle new patrons! Lol. \\n\\nThe food the second time around had some disappointments. They ran out of summer rolls, so we ordered spring rolls. Tasty, but prob over cooked. They would not allow us to order crepe AGAIN bc there was no time to cook it! :( I had the beef cubes again and the taste was just as good the first time! I decided to get Pho at this visit. #29. The soup smelled like cinnamon and I thought it was good, but my BF thought the soup base was bland. The noodles could have been cooked a little longer. You can pick a small or large bowl, but she never asked what size I wanted. I think she automatically gave everyone at the table a large. The meatballs were cut in slices, which made it easy to eat. My BF tried the rice dish with pork and shrimp, which he said was much better then the pho and something he would order again. They seem to use good quality shrimp here, which is a big plus. The leftover rice dish even tasted good the next day! \\n\\nI would definitely come back if I am around the area. Maybe not come on a weekend during busy hours? Lol. I might not be able to get in...\\n\\nFYI: Call ahead and let the owners know you want Crepe. Apparently It takes 30min to make.\",\"useful\":3,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":1}\n",

Don't let the location of this place deter you from trying it out because I guarantee you that you will be missing out on really amazing food.  \\n     The restaurant is directly connected to a Sapphire's Club strip club as in the door to the strip club is probably several feet off to the side of it which is located close to the strip behind the Fashion Show Mall in what looks to be stripper sex lane.  Pay no mind to any of that.  \\n     This place piqued our interest because it's 24\\/7 and it just doesn't get any better than that in the city that never sleeps, but it also has a promotional free flan with check-in offer. My partner in crime has been in an epic search for the best flan out there. The decor is really pretty with satin looking crafted roses as wall paper set against a more dim setting and a spacious area that has rounded booths, elevated tables as well as a bar area. \\n     We got a complimentary basket of nachos that was served with chipotle? (brownish) and a tomatillo salsa. Both of the salsas were flavorful, fresh and a refreshing change to the pico de gallo that is often served with nacho chip baskets. We ordered queso fundido as our appetizer. Flour tortillas are an additional $1, but it's not that big of a difference because the corn tortillas were delicious.  It arrived piping hot in a skillet and was quickly devoured in all of its melty, cheesy goodness.  For entrees, we chose the beef enchiladas in red sauce as well as a trio of tacos.  You can choose three tacos for $13. It may seem steep in price in comparison to the taco joints we're all used to frequenting on Tuesdays or into the wee hours of morning after clubbing,  but it's definitely worth it. We selected cochinita, carnitas and al pastor. Neil accidentally brought carne asada instead of al pastor, but he quickly went to get the al pastor and let us keep the carne asada.\\n     The carne asada was delicious,  but didn't make much of an impression on me. I always choose carne asada at my taco joints, but hey its way healthier here.  The al pastor complimented the sweetness of the pineapple chunks.  The cochinita was so flavorful and juicy. I have to really talk about the carnitas here. I have never had such flavorful and juicy carnitas in my entire life that is also organic. And I lived in East LA my entire life! Just thinking about that carnitas taco has me wanting to go back to Vegas. It's just taco heaven! All we were missing were Micheladas and everything would be complete.  The tacos are stacked with meaty goodness. My beef enchiladas came with a flavorful red sauce,  black beans (Your choice of black or pinto), and lime rice.  The black beans were standard and the rice was good, but nothing special for me.  I much prefer the fluffy, red rice that the suegra cooks up. Yum! The enchiladas were filled up with so much delicious beef. El Dorado also offers a seasonal variety of freshly made aguas - Neil offered us a sample of pina and jamaica (By sample,  I mean decent glass). The jamaica was ok, but the pina was great.  It had the perfect blend of sweetness that was subtle,  but delivered the pineapple flavor home. \\n     Now, the piece de resistance!  We were stuffed,  but just had to try some dessert. Neil took our complimentary flan check-in and we ordered some churros. The churros were perfectly crunchy with a soft core.  The caramel filling was a nice touch and could be enjoyed standalone. I really enjoyed the bananas foster one. It tasted similar and had the same consistency of a caramel dip, but tasted much better.  Now, I used to love flan,  but had too much,  effectively killing my taste bud for it. My partner in crime was anxiously anticipating the flan ever since we yelped it. The flan was cooked perfectly.  The caramelization of the sugar was just right. The texture of the flan was closer to a custard.  We both preferred a slightly more formed flan,  but with each bite came a flooding of goodness that our taste buds greedily gobbled up. It was a pretty divine.  Even the whipped cream and raspberry decorative garnish tasted delicious and real (organic).\\n     I can't rave any more about this place,  then I already have.  For starters,  it's great to see a server such as Neil who is attentive and on top of his duties.  Often times,  a great restaurant can be ruined by a horrible dining experience which is usually attributed to the servers.  Neil not only was informative,  but he was ready and available to answer any questions and owned up to the taco.  He was delightful to have as a server.  Chef Paco even took the time to bring out the complimentary flan.  After 1,000+ reviews, it was so nice to see a chef take pride and joy in his work. The biggest thing about this place is how healthy and organic everything is without sacrificing or compromising taste. This is gonna be a go to place for us whenever we're in Vegas.\",\"useful\":2,\"funny\":1,\"cool\":2}\n",

I took my 17 year old on Wednesday to get her shots.  She had not had shots for 14 years but I was adopting a new cat and thought I should get them.  I was not warned of any side effects or precautions with older cats and vaccinations.  Hindsight being 20\\/20, I have since learned that older cats don't even need vaccines and if they have them, should be given one at a time and 3 weeks apart.  My cat was a very high energy, adrenaline rush kitty - completely spastic most of the time!  She was barely 5 pounds but a small framed cat so normal for her height\\/build.  Upon entering the exam room, I placed the carrier on the table and the vet tech reached in and jerked her out by the nape of the neck.  This is a cat who hides in the corner most of the time and never comes out to meet new people.  She hasn't been out of the house in 8 years, only to move to a new house.  Had not seen the vet in 14 years as I didn't realize some vets will see them without vaccines.  Perfectly healthy cat with absolutely no health problems her entire life.  The vet tech then proceeded to put my cat down and hold her down - NOT a good idea with the Taz Devil that she became.  She had never bitten or clawed at anyone in her 17 years - but she came out Wednesday!  The tech had no idea what to do, threw her on the scales, let her go when she bit her (did not even break the skin), then the cat fell to the floor and landed on her head.  She backed into the corner and growled continually, then hissed when I or anyone else got within 2 feet of her.  We somehow got her back into the cat carrier so that we could talk.  Vet said she could sedate her for her vaccines - I agreed after asking the risks of sedation.  AT NO TIME WAS I INFORMED OF THE VACCINE RISKS UNTIL AFTER GETTING THE DISCHARGE PAPERWORK ONCE THE SHOTS WERE ADMINISTERED.  We left her there and went home, asked for blood work, physical exam, claw clipping, and some matted hair removal.  She had a coat like an Alpaca that would matt once a year - would not let me brush her much and sometimes I got lucky and was able to clip the mattes off.  I picked the baby up about 3 hours later - she was still growling.  The vet said they could not get her sedated enough to do anything other than vaccines....I said thanks, paid my $150 and left.\\nReturned home with a groggy kitty, to be expected after sedation and the trauma she endured.   Moved her box downstairs and let her rest.  Noticed Thursday she was having trouble walking, thought it was soreness\\/stiffness from shots.  Friday she was no better and Saturday I was worried.  I called the vet, could tell they wanted nothing more to do with her after she scared the staff - how do you work with animals all day and you cannot handle a 4 pound 14 ounce cat?  Vet said just to let her rest and that it didn't sound like the vaccines were causing it - to take her in if I thought she should go - well, that's kinda why I called....to ask whether I should bring her in.  After the horribly traumatic episode and stress on Wednesday (for her, not me) - I was not taking her back to that vet.  My normal vet was closed by then and closed Sunday, so I thought I would wait it out.   Sunday she barely walked and I looked up house call vets on the internet - called one to come to the house on Monday.  Kitty had not eaten much since Wednesday but was drinking water and peeing in the box.  We woke up this morning to find her dead in the closet.  Can I blame this on her being 17?  Maybe...but she was a completely healthy, spunky, energetic cat prior to the Banfield visit.  I believe she would have made it at least 5 more years if I hadn't chosen to vaccinate her.\\nI realize that Rabies is a state mandated vaccine and I \\\"had to\\\" get that one.  But the other shot?  The 5-in-1?  I am writing this so that other adult cat owners KNOW THE RISKS.  If you HAVE to give them shots, then do it one at a time and spread it out over the course of several months.  i ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO YOUR RESEARCH - I cannot believe as much as I research that I didn't!  I should have read and studied prior to going in - BUT I also feel it is a vet's responsibility to inform pet owners of associated risks and I was not notified at all - just that \\\"sedating a cat has the same risks as sedating a human.\\\"  AT NO TIME were risks associated with vaccines ever mentioned to me.  Is it Banfield's fault?  Well - perhaps if they had handled my kitten more gently and she had not been dropped on her head...I would not have been so stressed out, neither would the kitty, and we would have been able to sit down, talk, and discuss vaccines.  I was never offered individual vaccines in stages.  I didn't even know what vaccines were being given.  I had no idea what all of these shots and vaccines do to a 17 year old, not even 5 pound kitten when administered as a WHAMMY!\\nMy sweet crazy kitty would still be with me tonight instead of the tears down my face.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

Food selection was horrible with 5 small food stations with terrible selection.  The only seafood was what Treasure Island calls \\\"Sushi Bar\\\".

Pretty big piece of steak of about 8-10 ounces worth.  I'm a big eater and it was totally full and couldn't eat lunch during the day, just held out to dinner.  Lunch you must try their 50\\/50 burger which is Angus and Bacon!!  Yes, the perfect combo of a meat patty.  Then wash it down with their draft pint beer for $2.25.  They brew it themselves and is quite amazing flavor with 4 kinds of tap to choose from.  Dinner I had one of the best prime rib dinners ever.  I've gone to a lot of steak houses but this place at $15 is an absolute steal and deliciousness.  Give it the top award for value and flavor hands down.  Sorry Ruth Chris.  It is between a 16-20 ounce cut and cooked to perfection.  Photo's other's posted doesn't do justice to the amazing taste of this prime rib.  Service is always friendly and the restaurant is always packed with locals - Yes, the locals KNOW where to get the bargains and real dining experience of flavorful food.  Avoid the Strip restaurants at all costs including hotel ones reserved for the misinformed or cluest tourists.  During my week in Vegas I ate here 7 times: 5 breakfast, 1 lunch and 1 dinner.  Heck, eventually I had to try other restaurants too.  Anytime I'm in Vegas, this is my go-to reliable best value restaurant.\",\"useful\":0,\"funny\":0,\"cool\":0}\n",

    "\n",
    "SVDs are basically optimization algorithms which are based on power iteration or  subspace iteration methods. The SVD is defined as $A = U \\Sigma V^T$ where A is the recommender matrix, $\\Sigma $ are the eigenvalues and U and V are orthogonal matrices of eigenvectors. So if we use SVDs on unseen data we get The ratings via $R = Q P^T$ and $Q= U \\Sigma$ and $P=V$. So if we do the SVDs with minimum reconstruction error, we force different complications like that the sum of the reconstruction error is over all entries (no-rating = zero-rating) and we have missing entries and R (where classical SVDs is not defined). So our goal is to find $Q \\in \\mathcal{R}^{n\\times k }$ and $P \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d\\times k }$ \n",

    "Since P and Q are fixed respectively, the problem reduces to an ordinary least sqaure regression problem which has a closed form solution.\n",
    "Drawbacks of alternating optimization is that the solution is only an approximation , there is no guarantee that the solution is close to the optimal solution and its highly dependant on initial data/initialziation -> therefore we made the initialization method, to see the difference between a random initialization, and a good approximation with a SVD-initialization."

    "## Comparison of gradient descent and alternating optimization\n",

    "* Whats the advantage of sgd  and the difference between fbgd and mbgd?\n",
    "  - Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the whole dataset. This is great for convex, or relatively smooth error manifolds. In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution, either local or global. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using a single sample. Most applications of SGD actually use a minibatch of several samples. SGD works well for error manifolds that have lots of local maxima/minima. In this case, the somewhat noisier gradient calculated using the reduced number of samples tends to jerk the model out of local minima into a region that hopefully is more optimal. Single samples are really noisy, while minibatches tend to average a little of the noise out. Thus, the amount of jerk is reduced when using minibatches. A good balance is struck when the minibatch size is small enough to avoid some of the poor local minima, but large enough that it doesn't avoid the global minima or better-performing local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We compare the root mean square errors (RMSE) for the training, validation, and test sets different settings of $k$ for both alternating optimization and gradient descent.\n",
    "  - While varying the value for k, we can observe that a big k improves the loss on the training set but results in overfitting because bigger matrices Q and P can capture the data while training better. For Gradient Descent we found the best value for k to be around 25, for Alternating Optimization 100 produced the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We compare the test RMSE for the alternating optimization model and the gradient descent model. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - We found that the RMSE for gradient descent is lower than the one for alternating optimization. We also found from looking at the plots that higher ratings are predicted more accurately. Thats probably that the stochastic gradient descent do not end up in a local minimum trough the noise enabled because we dont use all the data and a learning rate."

    "Nowadays, recommender systems are present in all kind of applications, whether they are mobile or web, such as Amazon, Spotify or Netflix. For example, when buying a product online, recommendations suggest to the user the product that may be of their greatest interest according to specific preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to look for patterns of activities between different users in order to predict preference of a user with an item.  An example in the food industry could be: If most of the people who buy milk also buy coffee, a new person who has already bought coffee it's very likely that will also buy milk. This information could be used to place the products very close in the shelves to increase the sales and the profit.
